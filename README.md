Java Class called “Bicycle”

TWO properties: (i) colour – this is text, 
and (ii) size - this is an integer
A constructor to the class that will create a new bicycle based on a colour and a size passed as
parameters

A method called cycleBike() that will output a message saying “I am cycling the <colour here>
bike”
  
A main class called BikeShop.
  
Asking the user for the colour and the size of the bicycle.
  
# The validation rules are:
  
The colour must be text (you do not have to check that it is a real colour!)
  
The size must be a number between 16 and 30
  
If invalid data is entered, output a useful error message.
